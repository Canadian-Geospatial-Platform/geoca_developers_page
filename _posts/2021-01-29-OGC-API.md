# How to use the geo.ca OGC API endpoint

## The OGC API standards

Geo.ca has implemented the developing OGC API family of standards. These new standards build upon the legacy of OGC Web standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, CSW, etc.), but uses modern web standards to access geospatial content. As the OGC API standards evolve and are finalized, geo.ca will leverage these new standards in building interoperable systems to lower the barrier of accessing metadata.

Since the OGC API - Records is in draft, the standard is subject to change. By the end of 2021, more formal documents will be availiable from OGC and adequate warning will be provided when changes occur.

For more information on the OGC API standards, please visit the [OGC API Roadmap](https://ogcapi.ogc.org/).

## Geo.ca OGC API How-to

Geo.ca uses [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io/), which is certified OGC Compliant and an OGC Reference Implementation. At the time of this writing the version of pygeoapi is v0.10
